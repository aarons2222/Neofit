MetaTracker
=================

A streamlined activity tracker created on the MetaWear platform. The app demonstrates use of several advanced functionalities in the platform including accelerometer data, data logging, data processing, iOS API, and more.

## ATTENTION!
We use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) for dependency management, this means you need to open **ActivityTracker.xcworkspace** and not ActivityTracker.xcodeproj.
